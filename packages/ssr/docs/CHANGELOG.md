### Removed

- `JSONScript`, replace with a `serializationFactory` to support reading/writing outside of the react render, where appropriate.
- `eslint-plugin-markdownlint` (not used with update to ESLint 9, and was causing issues using `html-react-parser`)

### Changes

- made [`jsesc`](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jsesc) a dependency (as it should be), not a peerDependency.  From a time before proper use of [externals](https://github.com/stevenbenisek/rollup-plugin-auto-external).

### Changed

- updated to latest `@testing-library/react` to remove errant warning about import of `act`
- updated to `react@18.3.1`, set minimum required react to `17`
  - technically a breaking change, but `jsx-runtime` already introduced in [version 0.1.0](#010---2023-09-05)... so was already broken, oops.
- renamed commonJs exports to have `.cjs` extension to prevent `[ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]` errors in consumers that aren't `"type": "module"`

### Changed

- casing of `JsonScript` to be `JSONScript`
