## [0.9.2] - 2025-10-22

### Fixed

- updated the documentation to align with move to `variantPathMap`, missed in [version 0.9.0](#090---2025-10-21)

## [0.9.1] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed

- convert deprecated `unstable_config_lookup_from_file` eslint flag to `v10_config_lookup_from_file` now that [its stable](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/flags/#active-flags) awaiting next major version

## [0.9.0] - 2025-10-21

### Changed

- consolidated setting of default optional values
- changed `variants` array on join point data structure to a `Map` of relative to absolute path as `variantPathMap`
- move away from webpack `import.meta.webpackContext` when generating join points, construct a `Map` manually instead
  - add linking of join points, to supplant the functionality previously provided by `import.meta.webpackContext`
- updated win32 path replacement, can effectively no-op on posix systems

### Fixed

- removed "next" peer dependency, this needn't be explicit
- ensured files that cannot be resolved (by [enhanced-resolve](https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve/)), for whatever reason, don't break the build
- don't try and filter potential resolutions, let enhanced-resolve try and potentially fail, to allow for resolve plugins to have irregular specifiers (e.g. path alias')
- ensured that circular dependencies don't cause the module graph search lock up
- correct README.md to show `toggleHandler` as an option of the `pointCut`, not the general plugin configuration

## [0.8.3] - 2025-09-30

### Fixed

- Used the `prepare-publish.mjs` script provided by repo root version [0.12.0](../../../docs/CHANGELOG.md#0120---2025-09-30) to fix relative links in `README.md` on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) that were moved as part of [0.8.1](#081---2025-07-14)

### Fixed
