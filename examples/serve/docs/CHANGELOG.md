### Fixed

- set playwright image snapshot [max pixel difference ratio](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-screenshot-1-option-max-diff-pixel-ratio) to 0.05, to mitigate flaky false-negatives with Linux Chromium updates

### Fixed

- fixed some incorrect ports in the `README.md`

## [0.2.3] - 2025-02-27
