# Varying a Module after being Opted Out of an Experiment

## Explanation

This example demonstrates a feature varying a component after another feature has
not varied it.  This demonstrates the ability for multiple potential point cuts to
be considered, with the first one matching being activated.

## Activation

If an `experiments` header is set, with a `"test-feature": { "bucket": "test-variant" }`
decision, the "Control 1" (`component.tsx`) component is replaced by a "Variant 1".

If the `experiments` header is updated to set the "bucket" for "test-feature" to be 
"control", and a new a `"test-feature-2": { "bucket": "test-variant" }` decision, 
added the "Control 1" (`component.tsx`) component is replaced by a "Variant 2".
